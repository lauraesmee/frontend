#### 1. Never Underestimate the “Power” of Version Control
 The version control system (an open source distributed one) will help you regain total control over everything you'll change in a project (small or large). This way, you can see everything (“painted” in green, so you can differentiate your changes from the rest of the code) that has changed.

#### 2. Write Code as if Another Developer's Watching Over Your Shoulder
 The unbeatable argument for optimizing your code for the next person who'll need to use it: just imagine that you'd be in their position, to read, to understand and to efficiently use another front-end developer's code!

#### 3. Focus on learning core JavaScript first and it's then that you'll easily understand how each framework works. 
 I know that with all the frameworks, all the tools popping up every other day it's easy to lose sight of the importance to learn the very language itself. To learn JavaScript!

#### 4. Review Code and Get Your Own Code Reviewed
 Don't bee ashamed to ask your fellow front-end developers to review your code! There might be parts of it that you could improve and issues that you just can't see any longer after having worked on a website for a long time!

#### 5. Always make sure that those key parts of a web project that your clients might wish to edit one day, will be easily editable!
 You'll be saving your time, his/her time and this “commenting routine” will ensure you future collaborations as well (no client would want to be fully dependable on you for every minor change he/she needs to make to his website).
